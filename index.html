title: Human Keyboard
abstract: Don't be a human keyboard. Don't be a part of the culture that threats humans as input devices. Don't let them ask you to build a server everytime they need one. Give them the tools to build one. Don't let them ask you if site is down. Give them the tools to check if site is down. Don't let them tell you what to do, instead understand what problem they are trying to solve. Know your tools, don't let anyone tell you how to use them.
