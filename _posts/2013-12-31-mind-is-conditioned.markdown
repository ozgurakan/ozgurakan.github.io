World has to stop if it is what it takes. You can't drive a car with parts falling apart. You can't predict when the moving parts are so many. You just can't succeed no matter how hard you try, how much you want. You can't go fast with flat tires and far with an empty tank. You are responsible from all. Speak up now. Stop the world but not to fix the car. Stop the world to understand the car, to see it as it is.

Mind is conditioned. It is likely you won't see anything different. Stop the temptation to fix things. Define them. Understand them. The answer is not separate from the problem. The problem is not the flat tire but might be the road conditions or not the empty gas tank but the distance driven.

Are you able to see things as they are?

Are you the solution or part of the problem?

If you think you defined the problem but are not able to find an answer, that just means you couldn't define the problem yet. That means you didn't ask enough number of questions. You can't ask the right question for an answer you don't know but you can ask lots of questions until one of them hits the answer. Then, you can believe you found the problem which is defined by the question and the solution which is defined by the answer.  So, you look for the answers as much as you look for the right questions.

Problem, is the incomprehension of answer.

And I find it kinda funny<br>
I find it kinda sad<br>
The dreams in which I'm dying<br>
Are the best I've ever had<br>
