We all like automation. I do. You do. In fact you like automation so much that, you don't even want to use VirtualBox GUI in order to create VMs manually. You want to automate creating even local VMs that will run on your computer for maybe a few weeks or even maybe for a few hours.

Vagrant's web site says,

> Development environments made easy

and adds,

> Vagrant provides easy to configure, reproducible, and portable work environments built on top of industry-standard technology and controlled by a single consistent workflow to help maximize the productivity and flexibility of you and your team.
