If cloud computing is not magic and the APIs are not the spells, then what are they really?

An adult with an average IQ, I believe,  very well knows there is no such a thing as magic but it is the  "not understood" named after. We are usually comfortable with magic or lets say with the illusion as long as illusionist is capable of what he is doing. We know there is an explanation of what is going on and we are interested with the outcome more than the work behind the scenes. After all that outcome is what we are looking for at the first place. Not knowing, is what makes it worth.

You are OK with magic. Until the day,  white pigeon drops dead on the floor instead of flying around in glory. You might say "Well, I accepted there would be days like this" and, no doubt, that response will dramatically change if that is not the pigeon but your loved one that was hocus-pocused.

I like describing Cloud Computing through the analogy of magic and spells. Magic is effortless, or as difficult as whispering a spell. That draws the attraction. You say, it happens. You don't even have to understand the spell. You know, it just works.

Apple designs these beautiful devices, seemingly effortless until they tell you how challenging it was. Usain Bolt runs 100 meter at 9.58 with a smile on his face a second after the finish line, seemingly effortless until you find out how long it takes for you to run the same distance. Curiosity lands on Mars with a magical precision as a result of ages of experience and years of hard work.

Magic is the simplicity in the way the outcome is delivered to the audience. You can interchange the word "magic" with "cloud computing" in the previous sentence.  It is not the traditional definition of cloud computing but I believe adaptation wouldn't be remarkable if cloud wasn't about simplicity. Humankind likes simple. The simpler it gets the more familiar we feel ourselves.

Start instance, instance starts.
Stop instance, instance stops.

Simple.
