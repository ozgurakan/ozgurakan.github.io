abstract: What is the difference between Software Defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization? You can't really compare these two as they are in a way complementary technologies but also can be implemented alone.

SDN (**Software Defined Networking**), puts an API in front of the networking device so network rules can be programatically changed.

NFV (**Network Function Virtualization**), moves network functions, like router, firewall, IDS/IPS from appliances to virtual machines. 
Instead of using expensive appliances, these functions can be deployed on generic hardware and multiple time in different scales.

Maybe there is no need to note at this point but let me write it anyway, these two technologies are not alternative to one another but complementary.

OpenStack Neutron (api & qrouter) is a good example.
